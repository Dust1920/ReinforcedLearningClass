    abstract = "{Over the years, there have been discussions about the possibility of air pollution affecting the process of rain formation. In this study, we have developed a simplified model that represents the atmospheric dynamics and cloud microphysics to explore the impact of pollution on rain formation. We used an existing three-dimensional minimal model consisting of five equations, for which we added a simple bulk parametrization that represents the role of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in cloud formation processes. We conducted numerical tests using two CCN profiles, with either one or two accumulation layers and modified their abundance to explore the effects of different CCN concentrations and distributions. We conducted four numerical tests corresponding to the two aforementioned profiles with polluted and low-polluted scenarios. The numerical simulations suggested that a layer with high CCN concentration close to the surface tends to suppress precipitation, while the same concentration distributed over two layers tends to enhance the efficiency of rain formation. The simulations also showed that CCN particles far from the surface produced higher cloud tops and longer events, consistent with previous research. Although the model includes a stable representation of precipitating turbulent convection with bulk cloud microphysics, we expect its simplicity and conservation properties to allow for deeper theoretical analyses that can help us better understand the physical processes involved in the studied phenomenon. We hope this model will serve as a tool to explore different aerosol-related scenarios within the context of minimal models.}",

A method is proposed to construct approximate weak solutions, and we then show that this yields a convergent sequence. This sequence converges to a (pathwise) solution of the Cauchy problem. The equation can be considered as a model of deterministic driven phase transitions with a random perturbation in a system of two constituents. Finally we show some numerical results motivated by two-phase flow in porous media.},
